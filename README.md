# Battleship
Implementation of Battleship game in C - Version 0.1 is playable, but with bugs

This is a simple implementation of Battleship for C, as a part of my C language
certification which will help me understand better the utilization of vectors
in the form of `matrices[][]`.

To do: 

- [ ] - Implement gameOver() function with beeps - started but needs further development

- [x] - Implement makefile (Done on 04/Nov/2025)

- [ ] - Press (E) to exit the game not working yet
